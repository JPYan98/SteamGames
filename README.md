A sentiment analysis of Plant vs. Zombies and other popular games on Steam

The code includes web scraping, sentiment analysis, text mining, and visualization for reviews of video games on Steam.

Note: Scraping might be illegal!

Extracting information from websites through bots is usually frowned upon on some websites; it can violate intellectual rights, privacy, and information access regulations. Therefore, it is very important before scraping to always verify that the website allows it. Each company has its own rules.
